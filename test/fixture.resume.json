    "summary": "Software engineer who ships reliable systems, trims latency, and writes tests because future-me has already suffered enough. I like clean APIs, boring infrastructure, and documentation that doesn't gaslight people. If it's slow, flaky, or unclear, I'll probably fix it (and add a postmortem template while I'm at it).",
